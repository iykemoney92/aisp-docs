## Getting Started with Chat

### Basic Workflow

1. **Select a Model** - Choose based on your task and budget
2. **Type Your Message** - Be clear and specific
3. **Review Response** - Read the AI's answer
4. **Follow Up** - Ask clarifying questions or request changes
5. **Save or Export** - Keep important conversations

### Example Conversation Flow

```
You: I need to write a professional email to my boss requesting time off.

AI: I'd be happy to help you draft that email. To make it perfect for your
situation, could you tell me:
1. How much time off do you need?
2. What dates are you requesting?
3. The reason (if you're comfortable sharing)?
4. How formal is your workplace culture?

You: I need 5 days off from June 15-19 for a family vacation. We have a
pretty casual workplace.

AI: Here's a draft email for you:

Subject: Time Off Request - June 15-19

Hi [Boss's Name],

I wanted to request time off from June 15-19 (5 days) for a family vacation
we've been planning.

I'll make sure all my current projects are on track before I leave, and I'm
happy to brief [Colleague's Name] on anything that might need attention
while I'm away.

Please let me know if these dates work or if you need any additional
information.

Thanks!
[Your Name]

Would you like me to adjust the tone or add anything?

You: Can you make it a bit more formal?

AI: [Provides more formal version]
```

## Tips for Effective Chat

### 1. Be Specific

❌ "Tell me about Python"
✅ "Explain how list comprehensions work in Python with examples"

### 2. Provide Context

❌ "Fix this code: [code]"
✅ "This Python function should filter even numbers but returns an error. Can you identify and fix the issue? [code]"

### 3. Break Down Complex Tasks

Instead of: "Create a complete business plan"
Try:
1. "Help me outline a business plan structure"
2. "Write the executive summary section"
3. "Develop the market analysis section"
4. etc.

### 4. Use Follow-Up Prompts

- "Make it more concise"
- "Add more details about X"
- "Rewrite in a friendly tone"
- "Give me 3 variations"
- "Explain that differently"

### 5. Iterate and Refine

Don't expect perfection on the first try. Use the conversation to refine:
- Request changes
- Ask for alternatives
- Provide feedback
- Build on responses

## Advanced Features

### Temperature Control

Adjust creativity vs. consistency:
- **0.0-0.3**: Deterministic, focused, consistent (good for factual tasks)
- **0.4-0.7**: Balanced (default)
- **0.8-1.0**: Creative, varied, exploratory (good for brainstorming)

### System Prompts

Define how the AI should behave:
```
"You are an expert Python developer. Provide code examples for every
explanation. Prioritize best practices and efficiency."
```

### Response Length

Control output length:
- **Short**: Quick, concise answers
- **Medium**: Balanced detail (default)
- **Long**: Comprehensive, detailed responses

### Chat Templates

Save common prompt structures:
- Email templates
- Code review format
- Content outlines
- Research queries

## Best Practices

### Security & Privacy

- ✅ Don't share sensitive personal information
- ✅ Don't paste passwords or API keys
- ✅ Don't include confidential business data
- ✅ Review AI responses before using in production
- ✅ Fact-check critical information

### Ethical Usage

- ✅ Use AI to enhance your work, not replace critical thinking
- ✅ Disclose AI assistance when required
- ✅ Review and edit AI-generated content
- ✅ Don't use for academic dishonesty
- ✅ Respect copyright and attribution

### Cost Optimization

- Use GPT-3.5 or Gemini Flash for simple tasks
- Use GPT-4 or Claude for complex reasoning
- Keep prompts concise to reduce token usage
- End conversations when no longer needed
- Use projects to organize and reuse conversations

## Limitations

AI chat models have limitations:

### Knowledge Cutoff

- Models have a knowledge cutoff date
- May not know recent events
- Enable web search for current information

### Hallucinations

- AI can generate plausible but incorrect information
- Always verify critical facts
- Use multiple sources for important decisions

### Context Limits

- Conversations have token limits
- Very long chats may lose early context
- Start new conversation for unrelated topics

### Reasoning Limits

- AI can make logical errors
- May struggle with math (use code execution)
- Verify complex reasoning independently
